# Epic 14: AI Short Suggestion Pipeline (Completed)

## Overview

Successfully pivoted from the catastrophically broken AI filler word removal feature to a new AI Short Suggestion pipeline. This feature analyzes video transcripts to identify engaging, self-contained sentences that would work well as short clips for social media.

## AI Short Suggestion Pipeline

### 4-Step Process
1. **Extract Audio** - Extract audio from video using FFmpeg
2. **Whisper Transcription** - Generate word-level transcript with timestamps using OpenAI Whisper
3. **Segment Transcript** - Group words into sentence-level segments based on punctuation and pauses
4. **AI Short Suggestions** - Use GPT-4.1-mini to identify "short-worthy" sentences with scores and reasons

### Key Features
- **Interactive Suggestions**: Click suggestions to seek video and auto-play the segment
- **Color-Coded Scores**: Green (75%+), Yellow (50-74%), Gray (<50%) based on suggestion quality
- **Hover Tooltips**: Show AI reasoning for each suggestion
- **Auto-Trim Updates**: Clicking suggestions automatically updates trim range with 0.5s buffer
- **Batch Processing**: Handles long videos by splitting into chunks of ~30 sentences
- **Audio Preview**: HTML5 audio player for reviewing extracted audio
- **Expandable UI**: Show/hide full transcript and sentence lists with pagination

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: New IPC handlers for `segmentTranscript` and `gptShortSuggestions`
- **Frontend**: Complete refactor of `AIProcessor` component with new 4-step UI
- **State Management**: Integrated with existing project store for trim range updates
- **Error Handling**: Robust JSON parsing with regex extraction and comprehensive logging
- **Video Integration**: Seamless video seeking and playback control

### Data Structures
```typescript
interface WhisperWord {
  start: number;
  end: number;
  word: string;
}

interface SentenceSegment {
  text: string;
  start: number;
  end: number;
}

interface ShortSuggestion {
  sentence: string;
  start: number;
  end: number;
  score: number;
  reason: string;
}
```

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Step-by-Step Interface**: Clear progression through each AI processing step
- **Real-time Feedback**: Progress indicators and detailed output for each step
- **Interactive Suggestions**: Clickable suggestions with visual feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Scrollable suggestion lists with proper spacing
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for trim range updates

## Resolution Scaling Feature

### Overview
Added resolution scaling slider (25% to 100%) in Controls component to reduce export file sizes while maintaining quality options.

### Implementation
- **State Management**: Added `exportResolutionScale` to project store (0.25-1.0 range)
- **UI Component**: Resolution slider with real-time dimension preview
- **Proportional Scaling**: Fixed aspect ratio bug - both width and height now scale together
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Uses `scale=trunc(iw*scaleFactor/2)*2:trunc(ih*scaleFactor/2)*2` filter
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing `scaleToHeight` parameter as fallback

### Technical Details
- **Scale Factor**: 0.25 to 1.0 (25% to 100% of original resolution)
- **Step Size**: 0.05 (5% increments)
- **Default**: 1.0 (100%, no downgrade)
- **Even Dimensions**: Ensures video codec compatibility with even pixel dimensions
- **Real-time Preview**: Shows scaled dimensions as user adjusts slider

### Bug Fixes
- **Aspect Ratio Fix**: Resolved issue where only height was scaled, causing distorted videos
- **Proportional Scaling**: Both width and height now scale by the same factor
- **Example**: 1280×720 at 50% → 640×360 (both dimensions halved correctly)
