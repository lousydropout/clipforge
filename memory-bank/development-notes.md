## Technical Decisions

### Why FFmpeg CLI over WASM?

- Better performance for video processing
- More reliable for production use
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Native system integration

### Why react-media-recorder over custom MediaRecorder?

- Handles MediaRecorder API complexity and timing issues
- Provides reliable blob finalization
- Reduces custom code maintenance
- Better error handling and state management

### Why separate video/audio streams for screen recording?

- `getUserMedia` with `chromeMediaSource: "desktop"` doesn't capture system audio
- `getDisplayMedia` provides system audio but limited source selection
- Combining streams gives both specific source selection AND system audio
- More reliable audio capture across different platforms

### Why WebM during recording, MP4 on export?

- WebM is faster to record and process
- Reduces recording latency and improves responsiveness
- MP4 conversion only happens when user actually exports
- Better user experience with instant recording start/stop

## Known Issues

- None currently identified

## Recording System Architecture

### Audio Sources
- **Screen Recording**: System audio (speakers, applications, games)
- **Camera Recording**: Microphone audio with processing (echo cancellation, noise suppression, auto gain)

### Stream Capture Strategy
- **Screen Video**: `getUserMedia` with `chromeMediaSource: "desktop"` + specific `sourceId`
- **Screen Audio**: `getDisplayMedia` with `audio: true` for system audio
- **Combined**: Merged MediaStream with video tracks from desktopCapturer + audio tracks from getDisplayMedia

### File Format Workflow
- **Recording**: WebM files (faster, more responsive)
- **Export**: MP4 conversion only when user exports final video
- **Storage**: `/tmp/clipforge-recordings/` with `file://` URLs for renderer access

### UI Components
- **SourceSelector**: Dropdown for choosing recording source (Screen/Camera/None)
- **RecordButton**: Start/stop recording button
- **PreviewService**: Centralized stream management for live previews
- **VideoPlayerWithControls**: Displays both recorded videos and live previews

## Development Environment
