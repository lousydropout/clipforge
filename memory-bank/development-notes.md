## Technical Decisions

### Why FFmpeg CLI over WASM?

- Better performance for video processing
- More reliable for production use
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Native system integration

### Why react-media-recorder over custom MediaRecorder?

- Handles MediaRecorder API complexity and timing issues
- Provides reliable blob finalization
- Reduces custom code maintenance
- Better error handling and state management

### Why separate video/audio streams for screen recording?

- `getUserMedia` with `chromeMediaSource: "desktop"` doesn't capture system audio
- `getDisplayMedia` provides system audio but limited source selection
- Combining streams gives both specific source selection AND system audio
- More reliable audio capture across different platforms

### Why WebM during recording, MP4 on export?

- WebM is faster to record and process
- Reduces recording latency and improves responsiveness
- MP4 conversion only happens when user actually exports
- Better user experience with instant recording start/stop

## Known Issues

- None currently identified

## Bug Fixes

### File Path Export Issue (2025-01-29)

**Problem**: "Input video file not found" error during export, even when video file exists.

**Root Cause**: File URL conversion was removing the leading slash from file paths:
- Video import stores paths as `file:///path/to/video.mp4` URLs (for security)
- Export handler was converting to `path/to/video.mp4` (missing leading slash)
- `statSync()` and FFmpeg couldn't find the file

**Solution**: Updated `fileUrlToPath()` function in `electron/ipcHandlers/exportVideo.ts`:
```typescript
function fileUrlToPath(fileUrl: string): string {
  if (fileUrl.startsWith('file://')) {
    const path = fileUrl.replace(/^file:\/\/+/, '');
    return path.startsWith('/') ? path : '/' + path;
  }
  return fileUrl;
}
```

**Result**: 
- âœ… Proper path conversion: `file:///path/to/video.mp4` â†’ `/path/to/video.mp4`
- âœ… File existence checks work correctly
- âœ… FFmpeg receives valid file paths
- âœ… Export functionality restored

## Recording System Architecture

### Audio Sources
- **Screen Recording**: System audio (speakers, applications, games)
- **Camera Recording**: Microphone audio with processing (echo cancellation, noise suppression, auto gain)

### Stream Capture Strategy
- **Screen Video**: `getUserMedia` with `chromeMediaSource: "desktop"` + specific `sourceId`
- **Screen Audio**: `getDisplayMedia` with `audio: true` for system audio
- **Combined**: Merged MediaStream with video tracks from desktopCapturer + audio tracks from getDisplayMedia

### File Format Workflow
- **Recording**: WebM files (faster, more responsive)
- **Export**: MP4 conversion only when user exports final video
- **Storage**: `/tmp/clipforge-recordings/` with `file://` URLs for renderer access

### UI Components
- **SourceSelector**: Dropdown for choosing recording source (Screen/Camera/None)
- **RecordButton**: Start/stop recording button
- **PreviewService**: Centralized stream management for live previews
- **VideoPlayerWithControls**: Displays both recorded videos and live previews

## Overall App Flow (Planned)

```
Welcome Screen
 â”œâ”€â”€ Import Video  â†’  Epic 10 (Editor Core)
 â”œâ”€â”€ Screen Only   â†’  Epic 11  â†’  Editor (Epic 10)
 â””â”€â”€ Screen+Overlayâ†’  Epic 12  â†’  Editor (Epic 10)
                               â†˜ (optional) Epic 13 (AI Muting)
```

## Current System vs. Planned Epics Alignment

### What's Already Built âœ…
- **Epic 10 (Editor Core)**: 90% complete - has video import, preview, timeline, trim controls, speed/resolution adjustments, export
- **Epic 11 (Screen Recording)**: 80% complete - has screen recording with audio, but needs simplification
- **Epic 12 (Screen + Overlay)**: 60% complete - has two-track system, but needs PiP merging instead

### What Needs to be Added/Modified ðŸ”„
- **Welcome Screen**: New entry point needed
- **Epic 11 Simplification**: Current system is more complex than needed
- **Epic 12 PiP Merging**: Current two-track approach needs to change to PiP merging
- **Epic 13 AI Muting**: Completely new feature

### Key Architectural Changes Needed
1. **Welcome Screen**: Add as main entry point before current editor
2. **Single-Track Editor**: Simplify current two-track system for Epic 10
3. **PiP Processing**: Replace two-track recording with FFmpeg PiP merging for Epic 12
4. **AI Integration**: Add Whisper + GPT pipeline for Epic 13
