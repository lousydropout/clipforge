## Technical Decisions

### Why FFmpeg CLI over WASM?

- Better performance for video processing
- More reliable for production use
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Native system integration

### Why react-media-recorder over custom MediaRecorder?

- Handles MediaRecorder API complexity and timing issues
- Provides reliable blob finalization
- Reduces custom code maintenance
- Better error handling and state management

### Why separate video/audio streams for screen recording?

- `getUserMedia` with `chromeMediaSource: "desktop"` doesn't capture system audio
- `getDisplayMedia` provides system audio but limited source selection
- Combining streams gives both specific source selection AND system audio
- More reliable audio capture across different platforms

### Why WebM during recording, MP4 on export?

- WebM is faster to record and process
- Reduces recording latency and improves responsiveness
- MP4 conversion only happens when user actually exports
- Better user experience with instant recording start/stop

## Known Issues

- None currently identified

## Bug Fixes

### File Path Export Issue (2025-01-29)

**Problem**: "Input video file not found" error during export, even when video file exists.

**Root Cause**: File URL conversion was removing the leading slash from file paths:
- Video import stores paths as `file:///path/to/video.mp4` URLs (for security)
- Export handler was converting to `path/to/video.mp4` (missing leading slash)
- `statSync()` and FFmpeg couldn't find the file

**Solution**: Updated `fileUrlToPath()` function in `electron/ipcHandlers/exportVideo.ts`:
```typescript
function fileUrlToPath(fileUrl: string): string {
  if (fileUrl.startsWith('file://')) {
    const path = fileUrl.replace(/^file:\/\/+/, '');
    return path.startsWith('/') ? path : '/' + path;
  }
  return fileUrl;
}
```

**Result**: 
- âœ… Proper path conversion: `file:///path/to/video.mp4` â†’ `/path/to/video.mp4`
- âœ… File existence checks work correctly
- âœ… FFmpeg receives valid file paths
- âœ… Export functionality restored

### Epic 11 Implementation Challenges (2025-01-29)

**System Audio Capture Issues**:
- **Problem**: `getDisplayMedia` with system audio was unreliable across platforms
- **Solution**: Pivoted to microphone-only audio capture with dual recording architecture
- **Result**: Consistent audio capture with better user experience

**Microphone Permission Handling**:
- **Problem**: `DOMException: Could not start audio source` when enumerating devices
- **Solution**: Implemented graceful permission request with temporary stream creation
- **Result**: Smooth device enumeration with proper permission handling

**FFmpeg Audio Merging**:
- **Problem**: Multiple codec and stream mapping issues during audio/video merging
- **Challenges**: 
  - Stream specifier errors with `amix` filter
  - AAC codec incompatibility with WebM container
  - Experimental Opus encoder warnings
- **Solution**: 
  - Used explicit stream mapping (`-map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0`)
  - Switched to `libopus` codec for WebM compatibility
  - Removed `amix` filter in favor of direct mapping
- **Result**: Reliable audio/video merging with proper codec handling

**File Path Protocol Issues**:
- **Problem**: `file://` protocol prefix causing `ENOENT` errors in file operations
- **Solution**: Added path cleaning in main process IPC handlers
- **Result**: Proper file copying to user-chosen locations

**UI/UX Improvements**:
- **Problem**: Redundant source selection dialogs and poor workflow
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced dialog with dropdown source selection
  - Added export location requirement before recording
  - Removed post-recording editor redirect
- **Result**: Streamlined recording workflow with better user experience

## Recording System Architecture

### Audio Sources
- **Screen Recording**: Microphone audio with processing (echo cancellation, noise suppression, auto gain)
- **Camera Recording**: Microphone audio with processing (echo cancellation, noise suppression, auto gain)

### Stream Capture Strategy
- **Screen Video**: `getUserMedia` with `chromeMediaSource: "desktop"` + specific `sourceId`
- **Screen Audio**: Attempted via `getDisplayMedia` but unreliable, abandoned for microphone audio
- **Microphone Audio**: `getUserMedia` with specific device ID and audio processing
- **Dual Recording**: Separate MediaRecorder instances for video and audio, merged with FFmpeg

### File Format Workflow
- **Recording**: WebM files (faster, more responsive)
- **Merging**: FFmpeg combines screen video and microphone audio into single WebM
- **Export**: Direct save to user-chosen location (no MP4 conversion)
- **Storage**: `/tmp/clipforge-recordings/` for temporary files, user location for final output

### UI Components
- **ScreenSourceSelector**: Dropdown for choosing screen/window source
- **MicrophoneSelector**: Device selection with permission handling
- **ExportLocationSelector**: Native file dialog for save location
- **RecordButton**: Start/stop recording button
- **PreviewService**: Centralized stream management for live previews
- **VideoPlayerWithControls**: Displays both recorded videos and live previews

## Overall App Flow (Planned)

```
Welcome Screen
 â”œâ”€â”€ Import Video  â†’  Epic 10 (Editor Core)
 â”œâ”€â”€ Screen Only   â†’  Epic 11  â†’  Direct Save to User Location
 â””â”€â”€ Screen+Overlayâ†’  Epic 12  â†’  Editor (Epic 10)
                               â†˜ (optional) Epic 13 (AI Muting)
```

## Current System vs. Planned Epics Alignment

### What's Already Built âœ…
- **Epic 10 (Editor Core)**: 100% complete - has video import, preview, timeline, trim controls, speed/resolution adjustments, export
- **Epic 11 (Screen Recording)**: 100% complete - has dual recording system with microphone audio and FFmpeg merging
- **Epic 12 (Screen + Overlay)**: 60% complete - has two-track system, but needs PiP merging instead

### What Needs to be Added/Modified ðŸ”„
- **Epic 12 PiP Merging**: Current two-track approach needs to change to PiP merging
- **Epic 13 AI Muting**: Completely new feature

### Key Architectural Changes Needed
1. **PiP Processing**: Replace two-track recording with FFmpeg PiP merging for Epic 12
2. **AI Integration**: Add Whisper + GPT pipeline for Epic 13
