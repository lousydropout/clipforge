# Recent Changes Summary

## Epic 12: Screen + Overlay Recording Flow (Completed)

### Picture-in-Picture (PiP) Merging System
- **Dual Recording Architecture**: Implemented simultaneous screen and camera recording with separate MediaRecorder instances
- **FFmpeg PiP Processing**: Added `handleMergePiP` IPC handler for creating Picture-in-Picture videos
- **Smart Codec Selection**: Automatic codec selection based on user's chosen file format (WebM/VP9+Opus, MP4/H.264+AAC)
- **Format Respect**: User's chosen file extension is preserved with appropriate codecs
- **Direct Output**: PiP videos are created directly at user's chosen location (no intermediate files)

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Screen Source Dropdown**: Replaced simple button with `ScreenSourceSelector` component showing available sources
- **Camera Source Dropdown**: Created `CameraSelector` component for camera device selection
- **Dual Preview Players**: Added separate preview areas for screen and camera feeds
- **Export Location Integration**: Added `ExportLocationSelector` to "Dual Recording Setup" section
- **Completion Status**: Added green "Recording Complete" status instead of automatic redirection
- **No Workflow Redirection**: Users stay in Screen + Overlay workflow after completion

### Technical Implementation
- **React State Management**: Fixed timing issues with `useEffect` watching for both recordings completion
- **FFmpeg Filter Complex**: Corrected syntax with proper output label `[v]` for overlay composition
- **Audio Handling**: Implemented optional audio mapping (`-map 1:a?`) for graceful fallback
- **File Path Processing**: Enhanced path handling for different file formats and protocols
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallback to screen-only video if PiP merge fails

### Key Components Created/Updated
- **ScreenOverlayEditor**: Main component with dual recording and PiP merge logic
- **CameraSelector**: New component for camera device selection
- **ScreenSourceSelector**: Enhanced with better source enumeration
- **ExportLocationSelector**: Integrated into dual recording setup
- **VideoPlayerWithControls**: Updated to support dual preview players

### Bug Fixes and Challenges

- **Preview System**: Enhanced preview functionality with direct source selection
- **Export Requirements**: Added export location requirement before recording starts

### Bug Fixes and Challenges
- **System Audio Abandonment**: Pivoted from unreliable system audio to consistent microphone audio
- **FFmpeg Codec Issues**: Resolved multiple codec compatibility problems (AAC vs Opus, experimental encoders)
- **Stream Mapping**: Fixed FFmpeg stream mapping errors with explicit video/audio mapping
- **File Operations**: Resolved renderer process file operation limitations with main process IPC

### Build Status
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ No errors
- **Component Integration**: ✅ All new components working seamlessly
- **IPC Communication**: ✅ All new handlers properly registered and whitelisted
- **File Operations**: ✅ Proper file copying to user-chosen locations

## Epic 8: Data Structure Upgrade (Completed)

### Two-Track Architecture Foundation
- **Store Migration**: Migrated from `useVideoStore` to `useProjectStore` with two-track support
- **New Interfaces**: Created `VideoTrack` and `Project` interfaces for main and overlay tracks
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing single-video workflow preserved during transition
