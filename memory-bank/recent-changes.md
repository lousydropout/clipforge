# Recent Changes Summary

## Epic 14: AI Short Suggestion Pipeline + Resolution Scaling (Completed)

### AI Short Suggestion Pipeline
- **Complete Pivot**: Successfully pivoted from broken AI filler word removal to AI short suggestion pipeline
- **4-Step Process**: Extract Audio → Whisper Transcription → Segment Transcript → AI Short Suggestions
- **Interactive Suggestions**: Click suggestions to seek video and auto-play segments with 0.5s buffer
- **Color-Coded UI**: Green (75%+), Yellow (50-74%), Gray (<50%) based on suggestion quality
- **Smart Features**: Hover tooltips for AI reasoning, auto-trim updates, batch processing for long videos
- **Audio Preview**: HTML5 audio player for reviewing extracted audio
- **Expandable UI**: Show/hide full transcript and paginated sentence lists

### Resolution Scaling Feature
- **Resolution Slider**: 25% to 100% scaling in Controls component with real-time dimension preview
- **Proportional Scaling**: Fixed aspect ratio bug - both width and height now scale together
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Uses `scale=trunc(iw*scaleFactor/2)*2:trunc(ih*scaleFactor/2)*2` filter
- **File Size Optimization**: Reduces export sizes for social media while maintaining quality options
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing `scaleToHeight` parameter as fallback

### Technical Implementation

- **Feature Testing**: ✅ All features working as expected

## Epic 13: AI Auto-Muting (Filler-Word Removal) - **CATASTROPHICALLY BROKEN**

### AI Pipeline Implementation
- **Complete AI Pipeline**: Implemented Whisper + GPT-4o-mini + FFmpeg pipeline for filler word removal
- **Text Alignment Algorithm**: Created local text alignment to identify deleted words by comparing original vs cleaned text
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging for debugging AI processing steps with word-level timestamps
- **API Integration**: Added OpenAI SDK integration with environment variable support (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- **UI Components**: Created AIProcessor component with 4-step tabbed interface and manual progression

### Technical Implementation
- **Audio Extraction**: FFmpeg-based audio extraction to 16kHz mono WAV for Whisper compatibility
- **Whisper Integration**: OpenAI Whisper API with word-level timestamps using `verbose_json` format
- **GPT Integration**: GPT-4o-mini for text cleaning with optimized prompts
- **FFmpeg Muting**: Volume filter implementation for muting identified intervals
- **IPC Handlers**: Added `aiHandlers.ts` with all AI processing functions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper OpenAI SDK integration

### Why It's Catastrophically Broken
- **Whisper Limitation**: OpenAI Whisper ignores filler words during transcription, filtering them out
- **GPT Misidentification**: GPT receives clean text and incorrectly identifies key words as "fillers"
- **Catastrophic Result**: Important words get muted instead of filler words, creating nonsensical audio
- **Silly Example**: "just", "little", "few" get muted, turning "give me a little" into "give me a "

### UI/UX Features
- **4-Step Interface**: Extract Audio → Whisper Transcription → Detect Filler Words → Apply Muting
- **Manual Progression**: Users can step through each stage manually with "Next" buttons
- **Detailed Output**: Shows word-level timestamps, detected fillers, and FFmpeg commands
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and retry functionality
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for each step status (pending, processing, complete, error)

### Build Status
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ No errors
- **OpenAI SDK Integration**: ✅ Proper API integration with environment variables
- **FFmpeg Integration**: ✅ Audio extraction and muting functionality working
- **UI Components**: ✅ AIProcessor component integrated into Timeline
- **IPC Communication**: ✅ All AI handlers properly registered and whitelisted
- **Enhanced Logging**: ✅ Detailed debugging output for troubleshooting

### Lessons Learned
- **API Limitations**: Always understand API limitations before building features
- **Garbage In, Garbage Out**: Whisper's clean transcripts mislead GPT analysis
- **Testing Importance**: Test AI features thoroughly with real-world data
- **Alternative Approaches**: Consider audio-based detection instead of transcription-based

## Epic 12: Screen + Overlay Recording Flow (Completed)

### Picture-in-Picture (PiP) Merging System
- **Dual Recording Architecture**: Implemented simultaneous screen and camera recording with separate MediaRecorder instances
- **FFmpeg PiP Processing**: Added `handleMergePiP` IPC handler for creating Picture-in-Picture videos
