# Recent Changes Summary

## Epic 11: Screen-Only Recording Flow (Completed)

### Dual Recording Architecture
- **Separate Streams**: Implemented independent recording of screen video and microphone audio
- **FFmpeg Merging**: Added post-recording audio/video merging with proper codec handling
- **Microphone Integration**: Created `MicrophoneSelector` component with device enumeration
- **Screen Source Selection**: Built `ScreenSourceSelector` with `desktopCapturer` integration
- **Export Location**: Added `ExportLocationSelector` for user-chosen save locations

### Key Components Created
- **MicrophoneSelector**: Device selection with permission handling and audio processing options
- **ScreenSourceSelector**: Dropdown for screen/window source selection with thumbnails
- **ExportLocationSelector**: Native file dialog integration for save location selection
- **Enhanced ScreenRecorder**: Dual recording system with separate MediaRecorder instances

### Technical Implementation
- **IPC Handlers**: Added `recording.mergeAudioVideo`, `dialog.showSaveDialog`, `file.copyFile`
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Implemented audio/video merging with libopus codec for WebM
- **File Path Handling**: Fixed `file://` protocol prefix issues in file operations
- **Permission Management**: Graceful microphone permission request with device enumeration

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Removed post-recording editor redirect, direct save to user location
- **Source Selection**: Replaced redundant dialogs with intuitive dropdown selection
- **Preview System**: Enhanced preview functionality with direct source selection
- **Export Requirements**: Added export location requirement before recording starts

### Bug Fixes and Challenges
- **System Audio Abandonment**: Pivoted from unreliable system audio to consistent microphone audio
- **FFmpeg Codec Issues**: Resolved multiple codec compatibility problems (AAC vs Opus, experimental encoders)
- **Stream Mapping**: Fixed FFmpeg stream mapping errors with explicit video/audio mapping
- **File Operations**: Resolved renderer process file operation limitations with main process IPC

### Build Status
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ No errors
- **Component Integration**: ✅ All new components working seamlessly
- **IPC Communication**: ✅ All new handlers properly registered and whitelisted
- **File Operations**: ✅ Proper file copying to user-chosen locations
- **Audio Merging**: ✅ Reliable FFmpeg-based audio/video merging

## Epic 8: Data Structure Upgrade (Completed)

### Two-Track Architecture Foundation
- **Store Migration**: Migrated from `useVideoStore` to `useProjectStore` with two-track support
- **New Interfaces**: Created `VideoTrack` and `Project` interfaces for main and overlay tracks
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing single-video workflow preserved during transition
- **Component Updates**: Updated all 11 components to use new project-based state management

### Key Changes
- **VideoTrack Interface**: Added id, source type, path, metadata, trim times, and AI muting support
- **Project Interface**: Contains mainTrack and optional overlayTrack for future features
- **State Management**: Implemented `updateTrack()` method for track-specific updates
- **Import Process**: Video import now creates projects with mainTrack populated

### Bug Fixes
- **Duration Mismatch**: Fixed timeline showing 2:00 while video player showed 2:58
- **Default End Time**: Changed from 2-minute cap to full video duration
- **Missing Import**: Fixed Playhead.tsx import error after store migration

### Technical Implementation
- **Files Created**: `src/store/useProjectStore.ts` - New two-track store
- **Files Deleted**: `src/store/useVideoStore.ts` - Replaced with project store
- **Components Updated**: All 11 components migrated to use project structure
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained throughout migration

### Build Status
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ No errors
- **Vite Bundling**: ✅ 71 modules transformed successfully
- **Electron Packaging**: ✅ AppImage and DEB packages built
- **FFmpeg Bundling**: ✅ Executables properly packaged

### Future Ready
- **Screen Recording**: Ready for mainTrack source type "screen"
- **Camera Overlay**: Ready for overlayTrack implementation
- **AI Muting**: aiMutedPath field ready for AI-processed audio

## Epic 7: UI Enhancements (Completed)

### Video Player Improvements
- **Height Doubled**: Changed video player from `h-64` (256px) to `h-128` (512px)
- **Enhanced Prominence**: Video player now takes up significantly more screen space
- **Better User Experience**: Larger video preview for better content visibility

### Settings Organization with shadcn/ui Tabs
- **New Component**: Created `SettingsTabs.tsx` to organize all settings
- **Tab Structure**: Three tabs - "Trim Settings", "Output Resolution", "Export Video"
- **Component Refactoring**: Removed Card wrappers from individual components:
  - `TrimControls.tsx` - Removed Card wrapper, kept core functionality
  - `ResolutionControls.tsx` - Removed Card wrapper, kept core functionality  
  - `ExportDialog.tsx` - Removed Card wrapper, kept core functionality
- **Visual Polish**: Added styling improvements:
  - `pb-8 mb-8` on TabsList for better spacing
  - `cursor-pointer` on TabsTrigger for better UX
  - `border rounded-lg p-4` on TabsContent for visual definition
  - Added Separator component between video player and settings

### Technical Implementation
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Installed and configured tabs component
- **Import Cleanup**: Removed unused Card imports from refactored components
- **App.tsx Updates**: Replaced individual component imports with SettingsTabs
- **Conditional Rendering**: Maintained same conditional rendering logic (only show when video loaded)

### Files Modified
- `src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Doubled height classes
- `src/components/SettingsTabs.tsx` - New component (created)
- `src/components/TrimControls.tsx` - Removed Card wrapper, cleaned imports
- `src/components/ResolutionControls.tsx` - Removed Card wrapper, cleaned imports
